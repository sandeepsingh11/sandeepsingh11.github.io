	<strong>Freaky Fantasy (April 2016 - October 2016)</strong> - This is my first 'professional' piece that I composed; Freaky Fantasy. I wanted to do more of a spooky theme, and I think I did pretty decent job as a rookie. This was a time where a friend of mine made me appreciate the spooky, mysterious side of the world (this topic was already interesting to me, but now I wanted to spend more time in this realm), so part of this song is inspired from a new fascination for the creepy side.<br><br>
	Why I chose this title for the song is because of the meaning behind the words. <em>Freaky</em> obviously points to something weird or unusual. In fact, when I type 'freaky definition' into Google, the definition is, 'very odd, strange, or eccentric'. Building from there, <em>freaky</em>, to me, also represents the unorthodox ideas. This can be anything that people and society seem to brush off for whatever reason, like it's too weird, it's 'evil', lack of information, or simply a misunderstanding. In many cases these different, diverse ideas are rejected because of fear of the unknown. But with some knowledge and an open mind, these awkward notions become beautiful and valuable, which is where the <em>fantasy</em> comes in. This is the magical world in which all things weird and different exist and are portrayed in a magnificent and enchanting way. So I wanted to bridge these two motifs, of living in a marvelous world where conformity is nonexistent, and musically create an atmosphere where the scary, yet fascinating, themes can be given the chance to be conjured into this realm by an open-minded audience.

	<strong>Journey (August 2016 - ???)</strong> - COMING SOON... Journey is a 3-movement piece to illustrate the start of a new adventure. I started this piece when I entered my first year of university, so 'journey', in part, is my college experience, but it's up to the listener to plug in their own journey. I wanted to create a multi-movement piece for a while, so I thought it'd fit perfectly describing something that takes place over time. I also wanted to write songs depicting the emotions, which essentially is incorporated in each movement.<br><br>
	The first movement of the Journey piece is <em>Embark!</em>. This is the start of the adventure where the traveler, if you will, is ready to depart their 'home'. This departure is heard from the trumpets and horns, and it triggers the excitement for an uncertain, potential future. Along the way there are new paths to be taken and obstacles the traveler needs to surmount. <em>Embark!</em> contains the excitement and drive (this pulse being heard from the snare drum), which carries this movement through the hurdles. Soon, the sunset can be seen, and the the adventurer still has quite a way to go. Finally this piece ends with a fanfare similar to the beginning, as the traveler takes a rest with her mind still racing with adrenaline. However, there is a slight feeling of homesickness, and this feat took up quite a bit of energy. This restlessness is carried through the next movement.<br><br>
	With the full moon out, the adventurer seems to have gone a bit crazy as all her problems, both from home and during this journey, have surfaced simultaneously in her restless mind. In <em>Sorrow and Confusion</em>, the traveler decides to walk this unease feeling off. From the movement's title, this section depicts the moments along our respective journeys where it's very difficult to continue as there is a mass mix of emotions. Mostly a somber tone, mixed with a bit of frustration, resulting in a confused and defeated state of mind. The trombone starts with this creeping tone, followed by a low-voice quartet that sets the somber theme. Throughout this movement there are grace notes that resemble a person crying. In the middle of the piece there is a clarinet section feature and a double reed feature to more effectively express the mixing and unknowing of these emotions, soon followed by a sudden and brief outburst. Being a strong adventurer, she continues fighting on, but this does not last long. She cannot contain her emotions any longer as the tears come back. The short trumpet and horn feature is a vital turning point as this part represents the last-straw. The traveler finally lets all this tension out as she comes into agreement and acknowledgement of herself and her new stance. A great wave of relief floods foward as all that doesn't serve her is released. This piece concludes with the first melody finally resolving, as the adventurer preps up for the last leg in a new light of hope.<br><br>
	...and then...
